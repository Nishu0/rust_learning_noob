# Hello world

## Getting started

rust install hello world create directly `main.rs` and compile with rustc first check the version to know it is install then type `rustc main.rs`. a build file will be there run directly `./main` to see then in the hello world there is the **println!** macro every macro written with **!** bonus point highlight we will learn macro later.

## Using cargo

run other way is the cargo install with cargo you can do this otherwise `cargo new 1_cargo_world` write the `cargo build` and then `cargo run`

## Important points

- check rust version with `rustc --version` to verify installation
- compile directly with `rustc main.rs` creates a binary file
- run the binary with `./main` (or `./main.exe` on windows)
- **println!** is a macro - notice the **!** at the end
- all macros in rust use the **!** syntax
- we will learn macros in detail later
- cargo is the recommended way: `cargo new`, `cargo build`, `cargo run`

## Conclusion

this directory shows the basic hello world program in rust. we learned how to compile directly with `rustc` and run the binary, plus we saw the `println!` macro which uses the **!** syntax that all macros have. we also covered the cargo way of building rust projects which is the recommended approach for larger projects.
